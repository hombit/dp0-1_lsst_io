.. Review the README on instructions to contribute.
.. Static objects, such as figures, should be stored in the _static directory. Review the _static/README on instructions to contribute.
.. Do not remove the comments that describe each section. They are included to provide guidance to contributors.
.. Do not remove other content provided in the templates, such as a section. Instead, comment out the content and include comments to explain the situation. For example:
	- If a section within the template is not needed, comment out the section title and label reference. Do not delete the expected section title, reference or related comments provided from the template.
    - If a file cannot include a title (surrounded by ampersands (#)), comment out the title from the template and include a comment explaining why this is implemented (in addition to applying the ``title`` directive).

.. This is the label that can be used for cross referencing this file.
.. Recommended title label format is "Directory Name"-"Title Name"  -- Spaces should be replaced by hyphens.
.. _DP0-Delegate-Resources-DP0-Delegate-Homepage:
.. Each section should include a label for cross referencing to a given area.
.. Recommended format for all labels is "Title Name"-"Section Name" -- Spaces should be replaced by hyphens.
.. To reference a label that isn't associated with an reST object such as a title or figure, you must include the link and explicit title using the syntax :ref:`link text <label-name>`.
.. A warning will alert you of identical labels during the linkcheck process.

.. This section should provide a brief, top-level description of the page.

This page includes the guidelines, resources, and activities for DP0 Delegates.

**"DP0 delegate"** is the term for the 300 scientists and students who will have accounts in the Rubin Science Platform (RSP) at the Interim Data Facility (IDF) during Data Preview 0 (DP0). This term has been adopted to reflect participants’ important roles of representing the broad science community as learners, testers, and providers of feedback, and of sharing the benefits of their DP0 participation with their communities as teachers and colleagues. Delegates’ DP0-related activities will be supported with resources and infrastructure (as described below).

.. Review content in <https://confluence.lsstcorp.org/display/LSSTOps/DP0+CE+Planning>__ for content and structure.

.. _Delegate-Homepage-RSP-Accounts:

RSP Account Set-Up and Management
=================================

DP0 delegates must have a `GitHub <http://www.github.com/>`_ account in order to participate in DP0. Delegates will be contacted by Rubin staff to provide their username, which will be added to the XXXX GitHub Organization. Then, delegates will be able to log into the RSP at the IDF at `<http://data.lsst.cloud>`_. 

Questions about this process should be posted in the "Support -- DP0 RSP Services Issues" sub-category in the Rubin Community Forum, `Community.lsst.org <http://Community.lsst.org>`_, or submitted as a GitHub issue in the XXXX Organization **(NEEDS MORE DETAIL)**.

RSP accounts are **not transferrable** and delegates **must not share their password** with others. Delegates who are no longer using their accounts and would like to relinquish it to make way for others should please submit a GitHub issue in the XXXX Organization.
