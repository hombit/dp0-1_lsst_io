.. Static objects, such as figures, should be stored in the _static directory. Review the _static/README on instructions to contribute.
.. Do not remove the comments that describe each section. They are included to provide guidance to contributors.
.. Do not remove other content provided in the templates, such as a section. Instead, comment out the content and include comments to explain the situation. For example:
	- If a section within the template is not needed, comment out the section title and label reference. Do not delete the expected section title, reference or related comments provided from the template.
    - If a file cannot include a title (surrounded by ampersands (#)), comment out the title from the template and include a comment explaining why this is implemented (in addition to applying the ``title`` directive).

.. This is the label that can be used for cross referencing this file.
.. Recommended title label format is "Directory Name"-"Title Name"  -- Spaces should be replaced by hyphens.
.. _Data-Products-DP0-1-Data-Products:
.. Each section should include a label for cross referencing to a given area.
.. Recommended format for all labels is "Title Name"-"Section Name" -- Spaces should be replaced by hyphens.
.. To reference a label that isn't associated with an reST object such as a title or figure, you must include the link and explicit title using the syntax :ref:`link text <label-name>`.
.. A warning will alert you of identical labels during the linkcheck process.

The DESC DC2 Data Set
=====================

DP0 is based on the the simulated, LSST-like images generated by the Dark Energy Science Collaboration (DESC) for their Data Challenge 2 (DC2; arXiv:2010.05926). 
DP0 only uses the 300 square degrees of DC2 images that were simulated for five years of the LSST's wide-fast-deep component (WFD; also called the main survey) with a baseline cadence (i.e., a fiducial observing strategy).
For more information about the LSST regions and cadence see `Ivezic et al. (2019) <https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2019ApJ...873..111I/abstract>`_. 

For a synopsis of the DC2 image simulation and data processing, see this :ref:`Data-Processing-Overview`.
Below is an extremely brief summary.

**Simulated Objects and Images:**
The DC2's WFD simulated images include galaxies (with large-scale structure), Type Ia supernovae, stars (10% of which are variable), and Milky Way dust extinction and reddening.
DP0.1 does not include AGN or strong lenses, which are only in the DC2's simulated deep drilling fields (DDFs) and not the WFD images. 
DC2 does not include solar system objects, non-Ia extragalactic transients, or diffuse features (e.g., tidal streams, intracluster light).
The DESC simulated the DC2 images using the `imSim <https://github.com/LSSTDESC/imSim>`__ package.

**Image Processing:**
The DESC processed the simulated DC2 images with `Version 19 <https://pipelines.lsst.io/v/v19_0_0/index.html>`_ of the LSST Science Pipelines.
DP0.1 makes the DESC's DC2 images and catalogs available to RSP users with no further processing.
For DP0.2, the Rubin Data Production team will reprocess the same images with the most up-to-date version of the LSST Science Pipelines, and make the results available in mid-2022.

DP0.1 Data Products Definition Document (DPDD)
==============================================

Future data previews and Operations-era data releases will produce images and catalogs that more closely resemble the plan laid out in the DPDD (`ls.st/dpdd <https://ls.st/dpdd/>`_).
